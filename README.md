### Design project

#### Lil'Bot, an Augmented Reality & Previsualization project (Blender, Davinci Resolve):
**Solo Project**.  
**Description**: I created on Blender a simili of an AR application. Using (fake) AR glasses a user can have a robot companion. I think of the robot to incline people to try new things and doing good deeds and rewading them for those actions. I used Blender to create the robot, made the animation by hands. As for it's emplacement in space, motion tracking was used.
